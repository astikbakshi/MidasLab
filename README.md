 /****************************** Setup Instructions ************************************/

1. Obtain Stripe API Keys:
Go to Stripe Dashboard and create an account if you don't have one.
Navigate to the API section and grab your Publishable Key and Secret Key.
2. Add Stripe Dependencies:
In your pom.xml, include the Stripe dependency
3. Configure Stripe in your Spring Boot App:
In your application.properties or application.yml, add your Stripe API keys:
4. Create a Service for Stripe Operations:
Build a service class to handle Stripe operations like customer creation. Use the Stripe Java library to interact with the API.
5. Integrate with User Signup:
In your user signup process, call the Stripe service to create a customer and manage their data.
6. Test and Debug:
Implement thorough testing, especially in a sandbox environment, to ensure Stripe integration works smoothly.

/******************************* Testing ********************************/
1. Unit Tests:
Create unit tests for individual components using a testing framework like JUnit.
Mock external dependencies, like the Stripe service, to isolate the testing scope.
2. Integration Tests:
Set up integration tests to check how different components work together.
For Stripe integration, consider using a testing environment provided by Stripe (e.g., Stripe Testing).
3. Spring Boot Testing:
Leverage Spring Boot's testing annotations.
/************************* Approach ******************************************/

Implementation Approach:
Configuration:

Set up configuration properties for Stripe API keys in the application properties file.
Create a Stripe service to encapsulate interactions with the Stripe API.
Dependency Management:

Use Maven or Gradle for dependency management. Include the Stripe Java library as a dependency.
Service Layer:

Develop a service class (StripeService) to handle operations related to Stripe.
Implement methods for creating a customer, handling subscriptions, or any other relevant Stripe functionalities.
Integration with User Signup:

In the user signup flow, call the StripeService to create a customer profile and manage any associated data.
Testing:

Write unit tests for the StripeService methods using JUnit.
Use mocking frameworks (e.g., Mockito) to simulate interactions with the Stripe API during testing.
Write integration tests to ensure smooth collaboration between the Stripe integration and your Spring Boot app.
